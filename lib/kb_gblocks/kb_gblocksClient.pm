=item Description

** The workspace object refs are of form:
**
**    objects = ws.get_objects([{'ref': params['workspace_id']+'/'+params['obj_name']}])
**
** "ref" means the entire name combining the workspace id and the object name
** "id" is a numerical identifier of the workspace or object, and should just be used for workspace
** "name" is a string identifier of a workspace or object.  This is received from Narrative.
